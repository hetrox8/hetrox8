About Me

Hello! I'm Suleiman Yusuf Gacheru, a passionate cybersecurity specialist with a focus on network security, ethical hacking, and threat analysis. I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and am excited to apply my skills to real-world challenges.

In addition to cybersecurity, I have experience in full-stack web development using Ruby on Rails and React, which gives me a well-rounded understanding of how to secure applications from the ground up. I'm continuously learning and looking for opportunities to grow, so feel free to check out my projects or reach out for collaborations.

Projects
1. Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

Description:
Analyzed network traffic between two routers to identify potential vulnerabilities and anomalies. Captured packets with Wireshark and inspected them for signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity. I recommended mitigation strategies based on the analysis.

Skills Demonstrated:

    Network traffic analysis
    Packet inspection using Wireshark
    Threat identification

Tools Used:

    Wireshark
    Kali Linux

2. Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap

Description:
Conducted a full network scan using Nmap to identify open ports and vulnerable services on a home network. Generated a detailed report outlining the security risks and proposed solutions to secure the network.

Skills Demonstrated:

    Vulnerability scanning
    Network mapping and service identification
    Security risk mitigation

Tools Used:

    Nmap
    Kali Linux

Link: Project Repository or Case Study
3. Python Keylogger Development

Description:
Built a keylogger in Python as an ethical hacking tool for educational purposes. The project demonstrates how keylogging works by capturing keystrokes and logging them in stealth mode, all while following best practices for responsible disclosure.

Skills Demonstrated:

    Python scripting
    Ethical hacking techniques
    Stealth and keylogging mechanisms

Tools Used:

    Python
